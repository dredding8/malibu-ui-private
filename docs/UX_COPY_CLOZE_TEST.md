# UX Copy Understandability: Cloze Test

## What is a Cloze Test?

A cloze test removes key words from text and asks participants to fill in the blanks. It measures comprehension and whether copy uses language that matches users' mental models.

**Test Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Participants Needed:** 15-20 users (mix of novice and experienced)
**Format:** Remote, unmoderated survey

---

## Instructions for Participants

> Read each passage below. Some words have been removed and replaced with blanks.
>
> **Fill in each blank with the word you think best fits.**
>
> - Use your first instinct—don't overthink it
> - If you're unsure, write your best guess
> - You can write "I don't know" if you're stuck
>
> This helps us understand if our application uses clear, predictable language.

## Scoring Guidelines

### For Each Blank:

**Exact Match (3 points)**
- User wrote the exact word we use in the app
- Example: Blank says "Refresh" and user wrote "Refresh"

**Synonym Match (2 points)**
- User wrote a reasonable synonym that shows comprehension
- Example: Blank is "Refresh" and user wrote "Update" or "Reload"

**Conceptual Match (1 point)**
- User wrote something in the right direction but not ideal
- Example: Blank is "parameters" and user wrote "settings" or "options"

**No Match (0 points)**
- User wrote something unrelated or "I don't know"
- Example: Blank is "Refresh" and user wrote "Settings"

### Comprehension Thresholds:

**Per Passage (max 9-15 points depending on blanks):**
- **High comprehension:** ≥80% of max points
- **Moderate comprehension:** 60-79% of max points
- **Low comprehension:** <60% of max points (REVISE COPY)

**Per Word/Phrase:**
- **Clear terminology:** ≥70% of users write exact or synonym match
- **Moderately clear:** 50-69% exact/synonym match
- **Unclear/jargon:** <50% exact/synonym match (NEEDS REVISION)

---

## Analysis: What to Look For

### Red Flags:

1. **Wide variation in answers**
   - If users write completely different words, the original term is ambiguous
   - Example: Some write "Refresh," others write "Sync," others write "Get"

2. **"I don't know" frequency**
   - If >30% write "I don't know," the term is probably jargon or unclear context

3. **Wrong conceptual category**
   - User writes a word from a different domain
   - Example: Blank is "Collection" (schedule) but user writes "Folder" (file system)

4. **Overly technical answers from novices**
   - If novice users write very technical terms, they might be guessing based on what they think we want, not what they understand

### Good Signs:

1. **High exact match rate**
   - ≥70% of users write the exact word = predictable, clear terminology

2. **Consistent synonyms**
   - Users write different words but all conceptually correct
   - Shows the concept is clear even if specific word choice varies

3. **No "I don't know" responses**
   - Everyone has enough context to make a guess = good scaffolding

---

## Recommendations Based on Results

### If terminology scores <50% exact match:

**Option 1: Use the word users wrote**
- If 80% of users wrote "Update" instead of "Refresh," consider changing to "Update"

**Option 2: Add clarifying text**
- Keep technical term but add plain language
- Example: "Refresh Data Sources (Get Latest Updates)"

**Option 3: Add tooltip/help icon**
- Provide definition on hover for domain-specific terms
- Example: "Collection Deck ⓘ" → hover shows "Planned schedule of satellite collections"

### If entire passage scores low:

- **Rewrite for clarity:** Simplify sentence structure
- **Add context:** Users need more information to understand
- **Test alternative phrasing:** Try different words and re-test

## Quick Setup Instructions

### Using Google Forms:

1. Create a new form
2. Add demographic questions (experience level, role)
3. Add each passage as a separate section
4. Use "Short answer" question type for each blank
5. Make all questions required
6. Add consent question at start
7. Add "Thank you" message at end with contact info

### Using Qualtrics/SurveyMonkey:

1. Create survey with text piping for blanks
2. Randomize passage order to avoid fatigue bias
3. Set 30-minute timeout
4. Export to CSV for analysis

### Using TypeForm:

1. More engaging UI for participants
2. Shows one question at a time (less overwhelming)
3. Built-in analytics

## Example Follow-Up Questions (Optional)

After cloze test, ask:

1. "Which passage was hardest to complete?"
   - Identifies most confusing section

2. "Were there any words you weren't familiar with?"
   - Catches jargon we missed

3. "If you could change one label/term to make it clearer, what would it be?"
   - Gets direct user suggestions
